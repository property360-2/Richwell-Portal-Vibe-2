## üß© **2. System Modules (Functional Breakdown)**

### üè´ **A. Authentication & Roles**

* Login system (Email/ID + Password)
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Password setup for new students after enrollment
* Reset password (email or OTP-based)

---

### üìù **B. Enrollment Management**

#### Flow (Admission-Driven):

1. **Registrar** prepares subjects and sections (professor, schedule, slot limit).
2. **Admission Officer** opens the **Enrollment Workspace**.
3. Officer toggles between **New Student** and **Current Student** modes:

   * **New Student:**

     1. Completes the Student Registration Form (personal info, contact, program, year, semester, guardian details).
     2. Saves record ‚Üí system creates user + student entries, assigns Student ID, and emails password setup link.
     3. Enrollment Form auto-opens for the newly created student.

   * **Current Student:**

     1. Searches existing student by name/ID/email and selects them.
     2. System loads profile snapshot and recommended subjects.

4. Officer reviews the **Enrollment Form**:

   * Recommended tab pre-selects subjects based on program, year, and semester.
   * Retake tab displays subjects unlocked by repeat eligibility logic.
   * Manual selection tab (irregular students) lists all available subjects with section + slot info.
   * Inline prerequisite alerts and slot counters prevent invalid choices.
   * Unit tracker prevents overloading (warning threshold at 30 units).

5. Officer opens **Summary Modal**, confirms selections, and finalizes enrollment.
6. System updates admission dashboard metrics, student enrollment history, and section slot counts in real time.

#### Rules & Validations:

* INC/failed prerequisites ‚Üí hide or lock dependent subjects.
* Slot limits ‚Üí full sections hidden from selection.
* **Regular students** ‚Üí limited to recommended subjects only.
* **Irregular students** ‚Üí can pick manual subjects within eligibility rules.
* Repeat eligibility auto-calculated (major: 6 months, minor: 12 months) before showing in retake tab.
* No applicant portal; all registration and enrollment tasks are completed by Admission staff.

### üßæ **C. Grades Management**

#### Professor Side:

* View assigned sections
* CRUD grades per student

  ```
* Analytics: grade distribution, class average, INC count

#### Registrar Side:

* Approve updated grades after completion form
* Override if correction requested (with log tracking)
* Generate transcript/report summary

#### Student Side:

* View grades (per sem + all time)
* See GPA summary and INC subjects

---

### üßæ **D. INC Resolution**

1. Student sees INCs on dashboard.
2. Student + Professor meet.
3. Professor encodes updated grade.
4. Registrar verifies via physical form ‚Üí approves update.
5. System updates official grade record.

‚úÖ Digital workflow + real-world paper validation supported.

### üìö **E. Subject & Repeat Logic**

* Each subject tagged as **major** or **minor**
* Repeat rules:

  | Type      | Repeat After | Example                                     |
  | --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
  | **Major** | 6 months     | Failed in 1st sem ‚Üí can retake 2nd sem      |
  | **Minor** | 1 year       | Failed in 1st sem ‚Üí retake next school year |
* System auto-computes `repeat_eligible_date` when a student fails a subject.
* Enrollment form checks eligibility date before allowing re-enroll.
