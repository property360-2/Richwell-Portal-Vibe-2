* Regular = choose section; Irregular = choose subject per section

---

### üßæ **C. Grades Management**

#### Professor Side:

* View assigned sections
* CRUD grades per student
* Dropdown-only input for grades:

  ```
  [1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, INC, DRP]
  ```
* Analytics: grade distribution, class average, INC count

#### Registrar Side:

* Approve updated grades after completion form
* Override if correction requested (with log tracking)
* Generate transcript/report summary

#### Student Side:

* View grades (per sem + all time)
* See GPA summary and INC subjects

### üßæ **D. INC Resolution**

1. Student sees INCs on dashboard.
2. Student + Professor meet.
3. Professor encodes updated grade.
4. Registrar verifies via physical form ‚Üí approves update.
5. System updates official grade record.

‚úÖ Digital workflow + real-world paper validation supported.

### üìö **E. Subject & Repeat Logic**

* Each subject tagged as **major** or **minor**
* Repeat rules:

  | Type      | Repeat After | Example                                     |
  | --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
  | **Major** | 6 months     | Failed in 1st sem ‚Üí can retake 2nd sem      |
  | **Minor** | 1 year       | Failed in 1st sem ‚Üí retake next school year |
* System auto-computes `repeat_eligible_date` when a student fails a subject.
* Enrollment form checks eligibility date before allowing re-enroll.
