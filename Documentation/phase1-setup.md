# Phase 1 â€“ Local Development Setup

This log captures the concrete actions performed to satisfy the deliverables for **Phase 1** of the Richwell College Portal plan.

## Backend

- Initialized a dedicated Express project inside `/backend`.
- Added baseline scripts for development (`npm run dev`) and production (`npm start`).
- Declared dependencies for Express, CORS, dotenv, and Prisma (`@prisma/client` + `prisma`).
- Scaffolded `src/server.js` with a health-check route and environment bootstrapping.
- Generated a Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) with a placeholder model and MySQL datasource.
- Documented environment variables through `.env.example` and a backend README.

## Frontend

- Created a React + Vite workspace under `/frontend` with Tailwind CSS configuration files.
- Declared UI-centric dependencies (React Router, React Query, Headless UI, Heroicons, Axios) and supporting dev tools.
- Added reusable components (`Button`, `Modal`, `Table`, `InputField`, `Dropdown`, `Chart`, `DashboardCard`, `InfoAlert`).
- Bootstrapped `src/App.jsx` with example usage of shared components and Tailwind styling.
- Documented usage and startup instructions in a frontend README.

## Tooling & Housekeeping

- Added a repository-level `.gitignore` covering Node artifacts, environment files, build outputs, and editor configs.
- Noted dependency installation limitations due to package registry restrictions encountered in this environment (403 errors). Developers should run `npm install` locally where registry access is available.
- Highlighted Postman usage (per phase requirements) inside the application UI copy to reinforce API testing readiness.

## Next steps

With the scaffolding complete, the project is ready to advance to **Phase 2: Authentication & Role Management**. Future work should flesh out Prisma models, implement API routes, and connect the frontend to authenticated backend endpoints.
