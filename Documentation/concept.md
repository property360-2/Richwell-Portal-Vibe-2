# üß© **2. System Modules (Functional Breakdown)**

---

### üè´ **A. Authentication & Roles**

* Login system (Email/ID + Password)
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Password setup for new students (during enrollment)
* Password reset (email or OTP-based)

---

### üìù **B. Enrollment Management (Inside Admission UI)**

**Handled entirely by the Admission Office**

Students **do not log in** to enroll.
Admission staff handle both **new** and **current** students from one dashboard.

---

#### üí° **Flow**

1. **Registrar** creates sections linked to professors, subjects, and available slots.
2. **Admission** logs in and opens the enrollment dashboard.
3. Inside the **Admission UI**:

   * üÜï **New Student (Toggle ON)**

     * Shows **Student Registration Form** for data entry.
     * System creates a `user` + `student` record.
     * Generates Student ID and default password setup link.
     * Moves directly to **Enrollment Form**.
   * üë©‚Äçüéì **Current Student (Toggle OFF)**

     * Admission selects existing student (via search).
     * Enrollment Form loads automatically.
4. **System Auto-Recommends Subjects:**

   * Based on student‚Äôs **program**, **year level**, and **semester**.
   * Filters out passed subjects.
   * Includes **re-take subjects** if eligible.
   * Checks prerequisites and slot availability.
5. Admission confirms subjects ‚Üí summary modal appears.
6. Once saved, data updates **Admission Dashboard** and **Section Slot counts**.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Validation Rules**

| Rule                      | Description                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| INC / failed prerequisite | Subject hidden or locked until resolved       |
| Slot limit                | Section hidden when full                      |
| Regular students          | Auto-recommended subjects only                |
| Irregular students        | Manual subject selection                      |
| Repeat eligibility        | Auto-checks re-enroll period                  |
| No applicant process      | Admission handles all registration/enrollment |

---

### üîÅ **C. Automatic Repeat & Eligibility Logic**

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Rules

| Subject Type | Re-enroll After | Condition                                        |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Major**    | 6 months        | If INC or failed and not resolved after 6 months |
| **Minor**    | 1 year          | If INC or failed and not resolved after 1 year   |

#### üí° Behavior

1. When a professor encodes **INC** or **5.0**, system logs `date_encoded`.
2. The system checks the subject type and calculates eligibility duration.
3. When the period passes (6 or 12 months), subject becomes **available for re-enrollment** automatically.
4. During enrollment, the subject appears under **Recommended (Re-take)** list.

#### üß† Pseudocode

```js
if (subject.grade === 'INC' || subject.grade === '5.0') {
  const monthsPassed = monthsBetween(subject.date_encoded, currentDate);

  if (subject.type === 'major' && monthsPassed >= 6) {
    subject.eligible_for_reenroll = true;
  } 
  else if (subject.type === 'minor' && monthsPassed >= 12) {
    subject.eligible_for_reenroll = true;
  } 
}
```

‚úÖ The system auto-updates eligibility status at each new term.

---

### üìò **D. Subjects & Sections Management**

**Managed by Registrar**

* Add/edit subjects (code, name, units, type, semester, prerequisite).
* Assign subjects to programs and year levels for automatic recommendation.
* Create sections linked to professors and set maximum slots.
* Manage subject activation per term.

---

### üßæ **E. Grades Management**

#### Professor Side:

* View assigned sections.
* Encode grades via dropdown:

  ```
  [1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, INC, DRP]
  ```
* View class analytics: grade distribution, average, INC count.

#### Registrar Side:

* Approve or override grades (with audit trail).
* Generate grade summaries and transcripts.

#### Student Side:

* View grades per semester.
* See computed GPA and INC summary only.

---

### üßæ **F. INC Resolution**

1. Student sees INC status on dashboard.
2. Professor updates grade after completion.
3. Registrar reviews and approves.
4. System logs the change and updates GPA automatically.

‚úÖ Works for both online and manual completion forms.
